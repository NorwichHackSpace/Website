# How will we do this?
Our plan at the moment is to first build a community of like-minded people through face-to-face meetups, project shares and workshops, and through an online group which can communicate and discuss ideas and projects.

We will invite people to become members by contributing to the group financially. We will need to set up some kind of governance which we will discuss with the group as we go along.

Once we have a solid and committed group of members, we will start looking for premises. By this time, we will have developed relationships and will know how we want to run the group and a physical space. 

There are already many hack/makerspaces around the country who are willing to help and advise and we can learn from their experiences. Have a look at 

# Management of a hackspace
To make a hackspace work well so that it is safe and pleasant to use as well as being able to accommodate a wide range of interests, it needs some management. From the experience of other hackspaces, it works best if the responsibility for management and maintenance is spread over its members. 

We aim to create a community where individuals take responsibility for the hackspace as a whole and everyone is involved in improving the space. To make decision-making viable, we expect there to be a small team of trustees who will be entrusted to listen to the members and makes decisions accordingly. 

There will be house rules which will be agreed by the members. We aim to keep them to a minimum to ensure the safe running of the hackspace whilst allowing maximum freedom.

# How the money will work
A hackspace will of course have costs, rent, bills, taxes, purchasing equipment etc. Some organisations have gone down the road of getting grants and other cultural funding to pay these costs. The downside to this method is that the people supplying the money normally want some say in how that money is spent, and they will normally only fund short-term. This is normally unsustainable long term.

Very minimal costs to rent and run a cheap venue is around £10k a year. This could be covered by roughly 30 members paying £30 a month. This monthly subscription model allows the space to grow with the strength of its members.

We will also investigate the use of cheap or low-cost premises which are empty. Typically however, these spaces are insecure or short-term use. If we can fund our own rented space, we will have a more sustainable hackspace with less worry.

# Buying equipment through pledges
Pledges are basically the same as a kickstarter. The monthly subs pay for the regular running costs of the hackspace but pledges pay for one off equipment purchases. A member would create a pledge for a new bit of kit, say 3d printer costing £500 and once that target is reached (say 10 members might pledge £50) the printer would be bought and become owned by the hackspace for use by all members.
