# Members
A Hackspace is nothing without its members. To be able to pay the costs of running a physical space and buying equipment it needs people. Here is a breakdown of the London Hackspace: [Cost of Hacking](https://london.hackspace.org.uk/cost-of-hacking).

Many guides to setting up new Hackspaces warn not to borrow money or take grants until you have a community. Not only do you need the financial support but the life blood is the projects people work on and the energy they are willing to put in.

# How to become a member
Please join the Google group norwich hackspace [norwich-hackspace@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/norwich-hackspace) At the moment just getting involved is all you need to do to be a member.

Once we have enough people signed up we will find a workshop to rent and start collecting fees. If You want your profile on this page then email the google group with your bio.
