    <h1>Members</h1>
<p>A Hackspace is nothing without its members. To be able to pay the costs of running a physical space and buying equipment it needs people. Here is a breakdown of the London Hackspace: <a href="https://london.hackspace.org.uk/cost-of-hacking">Cost of Hacking</a>.</p>
<p>Many guides to setting up new Hackspaces warn not to borrow money or take grants until you have a community. Not only do you need the financial support but the life blood is the projects people work on and the energy they are willing to put in.</p>
<h1>How to become a member</h1>

<p>Once we have enough people signed up we will find a workshop to rent and start collecting fees. If You want your profile on this page then email the google group with your bio.</p>
