    <h1>What?</h1>
<p>A Hackspace (according to us, other opinions are available) is a community of folk who like to share knowledge, skills, equipment and space. It is nothing to do with the main stream notion of a computer hacker breaking into servers to achieve world domination.</p>
<h1>Aims</h1>
<ul>
<li>A community of like-minded people interested in making things</li>
<li>A self funded, community run, shared workspace. </li>
<li>Shared equipment, tools, materials, skills, experience and support.</li>
<li>Doing things that cannot be done as an individual</li>
<li>Have fun </li>
</ul>
<h1>Curious?</h1>
<p>Some people love working out how things work, how to fix (and break) things and making things rather than buying them. These curious people normally have multiple projects they work on in their own time. A hackspace aims to provide a physical workshop space where this can happen but also a community of like-minded people who are willing to help others work on their projects and specialist equipment that individuals generally can’t afford.</p>
<h1>Where are we now?</h1>
<p>Currently we are at the embryonic stage. We have a small collection of people that want Norwich to have a hackspace. There is still discussion about exactly what that will be and how that will happen. We don't have any equipment or even anywhere to put it if we did. We are organising regular meetings to discuss where we want to go and are planning on other meetups to showcase projects and share skills and knowledge. We ran an Arduino workahpo that went very well.</p>
<h1>What are we doing next?</h1>
<p>We need to attract members. This is not only to be able to start collecting vital funds for equipment and premises but to build the community as a whole. We need people’s opinions on what they want and how they would like it to be run. Longer term, we need a (home) physical space and some kit. A laser cutter will be high on the shopping list.</p>
